<p>Tender pork to use for tacos, rice bowls, ramen, or quesadillas. Anywhere that you'd want tender meat, this would work. This can be made ahead of time and stored for when you want to add meat to a dish.</p>

<li>1 Orange quartered</li>
<li>8 cloves of garlic whole, or smashed with a knife</li>
<li>1.5 Tbsp salt</li>
<li>1/3 Cup oil - I typically use canola, but lard is traditional from what I've seen</li>
<li>Bay leaves and fresh oregano</li>
<li>Cinammon - 1/4 tsp powdered or a small piece of whole cinammon. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you save some of the pork fat that is left over as it can be used for many other things. It always helps to have lard!</li>
<li>When making tacos or other dishes I typically like to crisp the pork up in either a pan or in the oven.</li>
<li>Additionally sometimes I just add uncrisped chunks to ramen with a bit of soy sauce and mirin.</li>
<li>Because of how tender it is it can be shredded very easily and distributed evenly among other ingredients.</li>
</ul>
