My personal site for my interests :3

Site theme is a modified `no-style-please` by by [atgumx](https://github.com/atgumx/no-style-please).

## Development

Built using Zola, so [install](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) that first to run locally.


Run the development server:
```shell
$ zola serve
```

Access the site at https://localhost:1111
