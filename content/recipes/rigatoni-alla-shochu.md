title = "Rigatoni Alla Shochu"
+++

Sounds like a classic italian dish, huh? All kidding aside, this is something I've been cooking a bit recently (summer/fall '25)
as a super-lazy cook-from-the-pantry dishes when I don't quite feel like cooking meat and want something slightly hardy yet refreshing.
This uses ingredients I always have on hand and takes no time at all making it a perfect weeknight dinner for one.

A while ago I saw this thunbnail for an Internet Shaquille video where he makes a Gochujang + Mezcal penne dish. Gochujang
seemed like an awesome addition, so I cached that thought to the back of my memory to be recollected upon someday. Well,
a little while ago I just randomly decided to make a pasta alla vodka dish and add gochujang, and realized "wait someone has done this before"
and finally watched that video. Good stuff!

A note, I say this is "0 prep time," because I do everything in the span of the water starting to boil. A true no down-time meal.

**Prep time:** 0 mins \
**Cook time:** 20 mins

## Ingredients
- 100-120g mezze rigatoni
- 1.5 tsp olive oil
- 1/4 onion - any kind, I usually just use white, finely diced
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 2oz Shochu - you can also use Vodka or Soju, but the sweetness of shochu is nice
- 1 Tbsp Gochujang
- 3 Tbsp heavy cream
- Parmesan to serve

## Directions

1. Start salted water boiling, and add mezze rigatoni when ready. This will likely occur while you're making the sauce.
2. Very finely dice the onion- borderline bruniose, and add to a hot sautee pan with olive oil
3. Sautee on mid-high to high depending on confidence until onion is translucent, and maybe starting to crisp a bit
4. Add tomato paste, and let it start to stick to the bottom of the pan. This helps develop a more 'roasted' flavor
5. Deglaze with shochu- make sure to do this away from open flames so as not to cause a fire
6. Add gochujang and stir to combine. I don't like to do this at too high of a head, so I don't nuke my kitchen
7. Add cream and stir to combine, allow not to boil too hard after this so the cream doesn't get curdled.
8. Taste and adjust seasoning
9. When pasta is ready, add to the sauce and toss to combine, serving with Parmesan on top
