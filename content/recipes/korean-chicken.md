+++

This is a pretty quick and tasty chicken to eat on a week night, takes no more than 20 minutes for the chicken itself and you can have rice cooking alongside. Additionally, if you blanch or steam broccoli you could add it in alongside. There are two variations of this dish; one made with cooked rotisserie chicken you've bought, and another with raw chicken.

**Prep time:** 5-10 min \
**Cook time:** 10 min

## Ingredients

### Chicken
- 8oz of chicken (Any part, boneless), either raw or cooked.
- ~1.5 Tbsp vegetable oil

### Sauce
- 1 1/2 Tbsp Gochujang
- 1/2 tsp Honey or brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp sesame oil

## Directions
1. Mix all sauce ingredients together until homogenous.
2. Prepare your chicken:
   - If using raw chicken: Slice chicken into medium pieces.
   - If using cooked chicken, shred by hand into pieces.
3. Heat pan on medium high and once sufficiently hot, add chicken and brown until it's almost all the way cooked through.
4. Turn heat down on the pan, wait for a moment (or move the pan off of the burner), and then add the sauce to the pan along with the chicken.
5. Return pan to burner on low heat and mix together and reduce down until the sauce coats the chicken, and the chicken is cooked through.
6. Remove chicken from pan and serve with rice or broccoli.
