## Directions

1. Mix chicken with dry spices, salt, and olive oil, then place in a 500 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. Check frequently so as not to overcook it.
2. Remove chicken from oven, let cool for a few minutes, then break into large chunks with a fork
3. Dice onion and cook over medium high heat with olive oil until translucent
4. Mince garlic and add to pan
5. Cut tomatoes into quarters and add to pan
6. Stir and cook so the tomatoes soften a bit
7. Add tomato paste
8. Add wine to deglaze
9. Add water as needed to prevent burning and so the tomatoes can stew slightly
10. Once tomatoes are softened, use a spoon to crush them completely
11. Cook mixture until dry, add paprika, liquid smoke, chilli powder, and rice
12. Stir rice for a bit, then add chicken stock in additions of 1/4qt at a time
13. Set heat to low
14. Allow stock to mostly cook off before adding next addition
15. Add chicken
16. After the third addition, check rice for doneness
17. When rice is almost done, allow all liquid to cook off and maintain low-medium heat to get a slightly crispy rice layer at the bottom
18. When rice is finished, remove from heat and serve with lemon wedge and sour cream dollop on top
