Mac and Cheese inspired by the X-Lounge in Charlottesville, VA. Uses a duo of sharp cheddar and gruyere for a strong cheesy flavor.

**Prep time:** 20 mins \
**Cook time:** 20 mins

## Ingredients
- 1 lb elbow noodles
- 1/2 lb medium gruyere
- 1/2 lb sharp cheddar (6mo+ aged)
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1 Tbsp flour
- 1 Tbsp arrow root powder
- 2 Cups milk
- ~1 Tbsp truffle oil

## Directions
1. Grate both cheeses and set aside
2. Make a roux by melting butter and whisking in flour in a saucepan
3. Cook for about two minutes on medium-low until slightly toasted
4. Whisk in cold milk in parts to ensure no clumping of roux (This is called a [bechamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9chamel_sauce))
5. Once the last of the milk has been added and the bechamel has thickened slightly, slowly add the cheese in parts
until it's fully incorporated and not 'stringy.' (This is called a [mornay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornay_sauce))
6. Cook pasta, strain, and add to the mornay sauce
7. Add cracked pepper, truffle oil, and combine
8. Add additional milk if it is too thick
9. Serve
