A collection of recipes that I've written and adapted over the years. These recipes are not "the" way to do many of
these dishes. Rather, they're just the ways that I make them, and how I enjoy preparing them. Cooking should be fun, 
anyways!

I credit my cooking ability to the following co-contributors: my wonderful mom who permitted me to make mistakes from an
early age, though it included the occasional burn and brownie disaster; my mentor Vincent who made me consciously
aware of every mistake I made, and pushed me hard to become an excellent cook; and finally my unbridled access to the internet
from a young age. There's really a lot of good stuff out there!

Please, enjoy these recipes. Cook them, report back, and if you have any questions do not hesitate to email me at `vaughnwoerpel@gmail.com`.
I'm happy to answer any questions, or provide additional tips.
