## Directions

### First cook (Boiling)
1. Combine all incredients in a large pot with water and boil for approximately 15 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.
2. Remove and place on a quarter pan and place in the freezer until fully cool and firm, but not frozen whatsoever. This can be done in the fridge as well but the freezer is far quicker.

### Second cook (Stir fry)
1. Remove pork from the freezer/fridge and slice thinly.
2. Add to a well-heated skillet or wok with no oil and cook until some of the pork is golden and depending on the size of the slices, slightly curled. About 4 minutes. If the pork has released more than desired oil, drain it off until desired amount is remaining.
3. Add peppers, sliced spring onion whites, garlic, sichuan peppercorns, and ginger and cook for about 2 minutes.
4. Add chilli bean paste and black fermented soybeans and cook for about 1 minute
5. Lower heat and deglaze with shaoxing wine
7. Add both soy sauces, sugar, MSG, and remaining green onion sections.
8. Serve with rice
