## Outline

After reading Name of the Wind, and seeing the description of Metheglin, I thought it'd be a fun thing to brew. As it turns out, Metheglin is really just a variety of mead that's made with botanicals and spices. Due to the huge amount of mead varieties there is a lot of room to play around with the recipes. For this one I chose to use juniper berries and rosemary for a bit of a botanical and piney flavor. For honey I chose orange blossom as it's apparently pretty easy to make it taste good and it also goes well with herbs and spices.

## Nutrient Protocol & Stabilization

For this recipe I'm taking a bit more of an 'intense' approach. Instead of just giving yeast some sugar and stepping away, I'm using some more advanced nutrient protocols in order to help the yeast do it's thing. This is far more important when brewing mead as opposed to cider, as honey on it's own doesn't contain many of the nutrients that yeast needs. I'm using Fermaid O, Fermaid K, and DAP in staggered additions during the first week of fermentation. As a final precaution I'm using spring water as well due to the fact that tap water can possibly kill yeast and doesn't have as good mineral profiles. Once the mead is done fermenting it will be stabalized to cease fermentation and then backsweetened to my desired sweetness.
