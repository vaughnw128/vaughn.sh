## Ingredients
- 5 Gallons Whittier Farm UV Treated Cider
- WLP 775 English Cider Yeast
- 2 Lbs Turbinado Sugar
- 3.5 oz. priming sugar for bottle conditioning (Added when bottling)

## Timeline
- 10/19/22 - Pitched yeast and started brewing
- 11/2/22 - Racked to secondary
- 11/14/22 - Bottled
- 11/26/22 - Tasted

## Taste and Notes

The cider had a starting gravity of 1.069 and final gravity of .999, giving it a finished alcohol content of 9.2%. This gave it a very dry flavor. Even with my inexperienced palate, I can tell that it tastes somewhat young and still a bit yeasty. However, despite this, it is still enjoyable to drink and is refreshing. I think I lost some of the benefit of using high quality starting sweet cider by adding sugar and making it much higher alcohol. In the future, I won't add any extra sugar and probably use a yeast with a lower attenuation in order to keep the alcohol content at an absolute maximum of around 7%. I think this would end up giving a more palatable final product that can be drank in higher quantities than the current cider. Over all, for a first attempt this went far better than I could have expected.
