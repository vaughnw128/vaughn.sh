# Vaughn's Site

Hello and welcome to my site. I've put this together to house some write-ups of my various interests. I hope you enjoy!

## Who am I?

I'm Vaughn, a 22 year old security engineer at New Relic living in Brooklyn, NY. I went to university at Rochester Institute of Technology, got a degree in Cybersecurity, and was a member of the RITSEC security club.
I have an interest in many different domains of security but hold a particular love for automation and tooling. I was a line cook at various restaurants for a few years prior to working as a security engineer,
and as such I have a section on this site dedicated to my recipes.

## Contact

I'm easily reachable via Email at `vaughnwoerpel@gmail.com`, or on Discord at `@wauhn`. I'm always open to chat about programming, homelabbing, cooking, anime, manga, you name it :)
